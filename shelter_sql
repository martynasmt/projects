AUSTIN ANIMAL SHELTER
This analysis is based on the publicly available dataset, made available by the Austin Animal Shelter (source: ). It provides information regarding
animals 

## To start, I have checked what kind of animals were admitted to the shelter

SELECT DISTINCT animal_type
FROM `austin_data.outcome_data`;

## In this analysis I decided to focus on dogs and cats only, so I have proceeded with creating a dedicated table to facilitate the analysis

CREATE TABLE austin_shelter_data.dogs_cats_data AS
SELECT DISTINCT *
FROM `paluch.austin_shelter_data.austin_summary`
WHERE animal_type IN ('Dog', 'Cat');


DATA EXPLORATION

## As a first step, I have checked the percentage of each animal type in the dataset - in this case, I have added a calculated column with percentage of dogs
SELECT (
    SELECT COUNT(animal_id)
    FROM `austin_data.dogs_cats_data`
    WHERE animal_type = 'Dog'
    )/COUNT(animal_id)*100 AS dogs_percentage
FROM `austin_data.dogs_cats_data`;

## To proceed with the analysis, I have converted the monthyear colum's data type from string to date

SELECT *, CAST(monthyear AS DATE FORMAT 'MON YYYY') AS month_year
FROM `paluch.austin_shelter_data.dogs_cats_data`
ORDER BY month_year;

## percentage of animals picked up by their owners

SELECT animal_type, (
    SELECT COUNT(animal_id)
    FROM `austin_data.dogs_cats_data`
    WHERE outcome_type = 'Return to Owner'
)/COUNT(animal_id)*100
FROM `austin_data.dogs_cats_data` AS percentage_returned_home
GROUP BY animal_type;

## In order to proceed with creating a Tableau dashboard, I have joined together the tables outcome_data and income_data, to retrieve the dates when 
the animals left the shelter.

SELECT *
FROM `austin-animal-shelter.austin_data.income_data`
LEFT JOIN `austin-animal-shelter.austin_data.outcome_data`
ON income_data.animal_id = outcome_data.animal_id;
