This dataset was created based on the publicly available database by a Warsaw based animal shelter "Na Paluchu". 
It stores statistics of in and outgoing dogs and cats between the years 2015-2021.
The purpose of the project


As a first step, the yearly dogs and cats summaries were joined together in newly created tables for further processing purposes:

CREATE TABLE shelter_data.pets_yearly AS
SELECT 
cats_y.year, cats_y.y_arrived_cats, cats_y.y_adopted_cats, cats_y.y_owner_pickup_cats,
dogs_y.y_arrived_dogs, dogs_y.y_adopted_dogs, dogs_y.y_owner_pickup_dogs, 
FROM `paluch.shelter_data.cats_yearly` AS cats_y
INNER JOIN `paluch.shelter_data.dogs_year`AS dogs_y
ON cats_y.year = dogs_y.year
ORDER BY year;

CREATE TABLE shelter_data.pets_monthly AS
SELECT 
cats_m.month, cats_m.m_arrived_cats, cats_m.m_adopted_cats, cats_m.m_owner_pickup_cats,
dogs_m.m_arrived_dogs, dogs_m.m_adopted_dogs, dogs_m.m_owner_pickup_dogs, 
FROM `paluch.shelter_data.cats_monthly` AS cats_m
INNER JOIN `paluch.shelter_data.dogs_monthly`AS dogs_m
ON cats_m.month = dogs_m.month
ORDER BY month;


DATA EXPLORATION

In which month the number of adoptions was the highest for cats and dogs?

SELECT month, m_adopted_cats
FROM `paluch.shelter_data.pets_monthly`
WHERE m_adopted_cats = (SELECT Max(m_adopted_cats) FROM `paluch.shelter_data.pets_monthly`);

SELECT month, m_adopted_dogs
FROM `paluch.shelter_data.pets_monthly`
WHERE m_adopted_dogs = (SELECT Max(m_adopted_dogs) FROM `paluch.shelter_data.pets_monthly`);
